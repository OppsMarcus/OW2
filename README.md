A step by step guide for building an OpenWRT firmware, installing and configuring it for TP-LINK MR3020 or MR3040 devices
---

Our objective is to obtain fully configured small device based on TP-LINK MR3020 or MR3040 router hardware with OpenWRT as firmware. It can be used for:
* Compact router with 3G/4G modem support
* Video surveillance (by USB web cam) device with ethernet, wifi or 3G/4G connectivity
* Remote, internet control of lighting, heating, automating etc. (need hardware hacks and additional components)
* Remote measure of temperature, air humidity, pressure and/or some other sensor reading (again need hw works)
* A lot of other things that can be powered by 400 MHz MCU and linux inside
